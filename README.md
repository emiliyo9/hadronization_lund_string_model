# Hadronization using lund string model

This is a simple simulation for hadronization using the lund string model.

## Dependencies
This simulation is made in C++ in combination with ![https://root.cern.sh/](Root)

## Features
+ All pions can be made
+ fractioning starting from quark or antiquark
+ Energy-momentum representation
+ Space-time representation
+ visualization and fitting of gamma distribution
+ visualization correlation rapidity energy-momentum/space-time

## Limitation
+ Energies of initial quark and antiquark are equal
+
