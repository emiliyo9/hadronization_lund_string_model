# Hadronization using lund string model

This is a simple simulation for hadronization using the lund string model.

## Dependencies
This simulation is made in C++ in combination with [Root](https://root.cern.sh/)

## Features
+ All pions can be made
+ random flavor and color of starting quark pair
+ fractioning starting from quark or antiquark
+ Energy-momentum representation
+ Space-time representation
+ visualization and fitting of gamma distribution
+ visualization correlation rapidity energy-momentum/space-time
+ color and charge conservation implied because of local white in mesons and breakpoints

## Limitation
+ Energies of initial quark and antiquark are equal
+ only u and d (anti)quarks (can be easily extended)
+ left over energy is not added to quarks
